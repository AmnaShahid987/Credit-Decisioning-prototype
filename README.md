# Credit-Decisioning-prototype
This repository contains a working prototype of a rule-augmented credit decisioning system built using fully synthetic data.

## Objective
Demonstrate how capacity, discipline, and life stability signals can be
combined to assign transparent credit risk labels without using PD models.

## Key Components
- Synthetic customer & transaction data generation
- Feature aggregation over 6 months
- Life stability scoring
- Rule-based risk labeling
- Clustering for behavioral segmentation (optional)

## Disclaimer
All data is synthetic. This project is for educational and prototyping purposes only
